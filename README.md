### 🤖 AI-Third-Party-Risk-Evaluator  
A multi-agent AI pipeline that evaluates third-party IT risk based on questionnaire responses.  
Built using Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Search, and Blob Storage, the system parses unstructured form data, retrieves relevant policies, and generates a risk report using prompt-engineered GPT responses.  
This project highlights enterprise-level automation and AI integration in a real-world risk analysis setting.

**Skills Applied**:  
- `Multi-Agent System Architecture`  
- `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)`  
- `Azure Cognitive Search` + `Blob Storage`  
- `Prompt Engineering` & `NLP`  
- `Semantic Search`  
- `Python (async, orchestration)`  
- `Business Systems Analysis`
